# Project Overview

This project was built to solve the problem of [problem description]. I focused on performance and accessibility from day one.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Inventory**: Synced across all users.
- **Secure Checkout**: Powered by Stripe Elements.
- **CMS Integration**: Easy content updates for the client.

## Technical Stack

I chose Next.js for its SEO capabilities and static generation for catalog pages. Tailwind CSS allowed for rapid UI development without leaving the HTML.
