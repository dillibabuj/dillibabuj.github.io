# My Tech Stack

Building my portfolio, I wanted a stack that was modern, fast, and easy to maintain. Here is a breakdown of the technologies I chose and why.

## Core Framework: Next.js (App Router)

I chose **Next.js** because it's the standard for modern React applications. Specifically, the **App Router** allows for easy layout management and optimized performance out of the box. I configured it for `static export` to host completely free on GitHub Pages without needing a Node.js server.

## Language: TypeScript

**TypeScript** is non-negotiable for me. It catches errors early and makes refactoring a breeze. It provides the confidence that my code works as expected before I even run it, acting as a first line of defense against bugs.

## Styling: Tailwind CSS

For styling, **Tailwind CSS** allows me to rapidly build custom designs without leaving my HTML. I used the latest version (v4) which simplifies configuration significantly. It ensures the site looks great on mobile and desktop with minimal effort and keeps the bundle size small.

## Animations: Framer Motion

To make the site feel "alive", I used **Framer Motion**. It's a powerful library that makes adding complex animations—like the entrance effects on my home page—declarative and simple. It adds that layer of polish that makes a site feel premium.

## Content: MDX

The blog and project pages are powered by **MDX**. This allows me to write content in Markdown while being able to embed interactive React components directly into my posts. It's the perfect balance between writing ease and development flexibility.

## Deployment: GitHub Pages

Since this is a fully static site, **GitHub Pages** is the perfect host. It's free, fast, and deploys automatically whenever I push code to my repository.
